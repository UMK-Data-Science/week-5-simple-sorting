This tutorial consists with 3 questions. Try to complete this tutorial by commit your changes and read the questions carefully :smile: 

# Exercise 1
Given unsorted array UA[]={5,1,4,2,8}, write a C program to sort a list of elements using Bubble Sort Algorithm
Next, calculate number of passes and comparisons required from the program

```
Input
UA[]={5,1,4,2,8}
```

```
Expected Output
Sorted Element using Bubble Sort Technique is 1,2,4,5,8
```

# Exercise 2
Given unsorted array UA[]={5,1,4,2,8}, write a C program to sort a list of elements using Selection Sort Algorithm

```
Input
UA[]={5,1,4,2,8}
```

```
Expected Output
Sorted Element using Selection Sort Technique is 1,2,4,5,8
```

# Exercise 3
Given unsorted array UA[]={5,1,4,2,8}, write a C program to sort a list of elements using Insertion Sort Algorithm

```
Input
UA[]={5,1,4,2,8}
```

```
Expected Output
Sorted Element using Insertion Sort Technique is 1,2,4,5,8
```
